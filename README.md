# UAV-Based Deep Learning Techniques for Early Detection of Corn Plant Diseases

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the early detection of corn plant diseases using UAV imagery and deep learning techniques. The aim is to develop and validate models that can accurately identify healthy and unhealthy corn plant leaves, thereby enabling timely interventions to safeguard food security.

## Features
- Implementation of three deep learning models: CNN, Vision Transformer, and Fully Convolutional Auto-Encoder
- Use of UAV imagery to train and validate the models
- Comparative analysis of model performance to identify the most effective approach

## Models Used
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Vision Transformer
- Fully Convolutional Auto-Encoder

## Results
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of the Fully Convolutional Auto-Encoder model in detecting corn plant diseases with an accuracy of 95.09%, outperforming both the Vision Transformer and CNN models. This approach enables early and accurate disease identification, facilitating timely interventions and improving crop protection.
